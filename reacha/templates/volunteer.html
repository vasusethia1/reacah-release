Members are requested to adhere to the REACHA Code of Conduct while volunteering, which is as follows:<br><br>

CODE OF CONDUCT FOR REACHA VOLUNTEERS (Individuals/Forums/Organizations<br><br>

Volunteering for REACHA is by choice.<br><br>

REACHA volunteers should strive to share their time and talent for taking up issues of local, regional and national concerns in tune with their bent of mind, in a spirit of camaraderie and social cohesion.<br><br>

REACHA volunteers should be interested in 'reaching out' through maitreya (friendliness) to make a 'positive difference' in their home, colleges & neighbourhood.<br><br>

Each volunteer should seek to observe a 'felt need' around them which requires intervention. Solutions to this need may be many, with some of them having already been worked out, & under implementation, elsewhere.<br><br>

REACHA volunteers should seek to be positive and pro-active towards various issues, and expend less time and energy in being critical and obstructive to various activities of the organization or any other.<br><br>

REACHA volunteers should always uphold national interest first in all their deliberations.<br><br>

REACHA volunteers should seek to be co-operative to the efforts of other volunteers in the organisation. Constructive criticism is welcome, but frivolous debate and discussion should be avoided by one and all.<br><br>

REACHA volunteers must understand that there is always an excuse for not doing something. If they are really passionate about an issue then it is entirely up to them to take charge of that issue and then develop it accordingly.<br><br>

REACHA volunteers should strictly adhere to time schedules committed by them. Volunteers should strive to deliver whatever promised at least one day prior to the scheduled date in order to make a statement about REACHA’s commitment towards its objectives.<br><br>

REACHA volunteers should appreciate that every other volunteer is just as busy and occupied as they are. Thus, each volunteer should follow basic norms of consideration for others to the best of their capability.<br><br>

REACHA volunteers should not expect any personal benefits from their volunteering for the association. Rather, they would strive to give to the association whatever best they can as conscientious Indian citizens.<br><br>

REACHA volunteers should not commit more than they are capable of delivering.<br><br>

REACHA volunteers can make a choice of either contributing to ongoing projects/debates/discussions undertaken by the organization or be part of new start-up projects/debates/discussions under support & guidance from senior REACHA activists.<br><br>

REACHA volunteers should not seek any personal favors from any individual or organization in the course of the fulfillment of their commitments. Benefits that may accrue as a by-product to constructive synergies are welcome.<br><br>

REACHA volunteers should always seek to adopt the most economical and frugal practices/methodologies in their work, and in the setting up and running of their forums/groups etc.<br><br>

REACHA volunteers should not seek publicity for their work. They should follow the dictum – ‘real work speaks for itself.'<br><br>

REACHA volunteers should always remain transparent in their activities and documentation work – in spirit as well as action.<br><br>

REACHA volunteers should remain committed to the overall objectives of the organisation in the true spirit of volunteerism and social commitment in their spare time, to pursue their societal commitments.<br><br>

REACHA would strive to function as a facilitator par excellence and would encourage networking of all like-minded individuals/youth forums/NGOs/Corporates/Govt in the true spirit of ‘open source’ knowledge sharing.<br><br>

Successful volunteering stints will be awarded Volunteering Participation Certificates/Letters. Outstanding efforts will be rewarded with Volunteering Merit Certificates/Letters.</p>

More often than not the child of yesteryear now begins a life of confusion, dilemmas and contradictions. Peer pressure, mounting parental expectation and the media/info blitzkrieg begin to take their toll straight away. A good way to positively divert this young mind is through college volunteering.<br><br>

Students are involved in projects/programmes to 'give back' to the society - to 'make a difference.'<br><br>

REACHA seeks to involve college students through field volunteering as well as e-volunteering (whereby students can volunteer for us right from their homes, college hostels, institutes etc) in:<br><br>

<ul> 
<li style="color:rgb(0,0,0,0.9);font-size: 16px;font-family:Georgia,serif;line-height:30px;text-align: justify;">  Doing online research for preparing content for our ongoing projects</li>

 
<li style="color:rgb(0,0,0,0.9);font-size: 16px;font-family:Georgia,serif;line-height:30px;text-align: justify;">  Volunteer to help us conduct the LIVE workshops</li>

Corporate Social Responsibility is a buzzword in many a corridors of power at corporate centers. However, many do not know how to get started. In many ways - even though the intent is there - the corporate entity is unable to pitch in for various reasons. <br><br>

REACHA seeks such conscientious corporates as well as their executives through: <br>
<ul> 
<li style="color:rgb(0,0,0,0.9);font-size: 16px;font-family:Georgia,serif;line-height:30px;text-align: justify;"> Corporate volunteering - online as well as during LIVE  PROJECTS </li>

<li style="color:rgb(0,0,0,0.9);font-size: 16px;font-family:Georgia,serif;line-height:30px;text-align: justify;" > Sharing their expert advice with us to strengthen the programme - through time and space</li>

</ul>

REACHA seeks to involve corporate executives through field volunteering as well as e-volunteering (whereby they can volunteer for us right from their homes, offices etc) in: <br><br>
<ul>
<li>     Doing online research for our projects </li>



<li>    Engage in meaningful 'peer group mentoring' of school children involved in our projects - through online forums as well as counseling workshop in schools and colleges </li>

Sadly, the RUSH HOUR lifestyle today is taking them away - far away - from their own kids.<br><br> 

Neighbourhoods are getting more and more isolated and the nuclear family is more of a pseudo-nuclear one today. With both parents spending little time together with kids and not knowing much about their neighbour - the urban society is in a phase of gradual disintegration. <br><br> 

REACHA seeks the voluntary spirit in parents to come forward - and try to become role models in the neighbourhood. For this we need their time and not money. Shared parenting is a beautiful concept - with parents helping each other out in rearing their children. <br><br> 

REACHA dreams for the day when more and parents can come out during weekends and JUST PLAY with children in the neighbourhood. We assure you SOME RESULTS - <br>
<ul>
<li style="color:rgb(0,0,0,0.9);font-size: 16px;font-family:Georgia,serif;line-height:30px;text-align: justify;">Tremendous bonding with your kids</li>

<li style="color:rgb(0,0,0,0.9);font-size: 16px;font-family:Georgia,serif;line-height:30px;text-align: justify;">Initiation of a process to discover the 'child within'</li>

<li style="color:rgb(0,0,0,0.9);font-size: 16px;font-family:Georgia,serif;line-height:30px;text-align: justify;"> Stress busting</li>

<li style="color:rgb(0,0,0,0.9);font-size: 16px;font-family:Georgia,serif;line-height:30px;text-align: justify;">New friendships with your child's friends - your children will adore you for this</li>

<li style="color:rgb(0,0,0,0.9);font-size: 16px;font-family:Georgia,serif;line-height:30px;text-align: justify;">New friendships with parents in the neighbourhood</li>

Here, a child is provided care by teachers - but there is a convergence, a partnership between the teacher and the parent in the whole process.<br><br> 

REACHA seeks to excite every teacher - to ignite the spark 'within' that will give them the desire, the courage to go 'beyond' and explore the hidden potential of every child.<br><br> 

REACHA urges teachers to volunteer and come forward. The process will be enlightening for them too as the dynamics of our programmes, and the interactivity generated is bound to also assist their own evolution as a human being.<br><br>

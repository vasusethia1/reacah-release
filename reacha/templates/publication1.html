                      <p style="margin-top: 2%;color:rgb(0,0,0,0.9);font-size: 21.5px;">REACHA has been supported by ONGC in its partnership with Indian Army at Baramulla, Kashmir. The projects underway include skill development trainings and drug de-addiction. These are undertaken within army campus of 19 Arty Brigade at Baramulla. The training centre is called the Chinar 9 Jawan Club, Baramulla. The concept of the Club was initiated by the army to ‘constructively engage’ with youth in the valley so as to peacefully wean them away from militancy, drug addiction, anti-national activities etc., and to enable them to meaningfully contribute to national development.<br><br>
The partnership between ONGC, Indian Army & REACHA began in the year 2016 with ONGC supporting a total of 60 girls for 2 batches of 6 months each, on Fashion Designing, Cutting & Sewing Course. This course is certified by ASSOCHAM. Till date 240 young women have undergone this training with more than 60% engaged in livelihood enhancement activities post the training. Since 2017-18, 150 youth each year have been trained in trades of Retail and Hospitality with NSDC certification – totalling overall 900 numbers. Here too, despite numerous challenges 50-60% placements / livelihood enhancement has been achieved.<br><br>

Since 2019-20 we have also started training 60 youth a year on music to provide innovative incremental livelihood enhancement opportunities to the youth.</p>

                      <p>The project is quite popular and during times of Covid-19 lockdown, our young musicians have provided soothing and melodious music calling upon the community to maintain social distance and other Covid-19 Combat requirements. Since 2019-20, we are also working to provide drug-de-addiction and rehab support to 1200 Kashmiri youth who are often targets of drugs to misguide them. With ONGC support houses of villagers broken down due to counterinsurgency operations were rebuilt in Uri by REACHA in the year 2017-18. This bridged the divide and brought local village communities close to the army near LoC with Pakistan. Also, Porta Cabins have been installed with ONGC support at Chinar 9 Jawan Club and Drug De-addiction Center to augment existing infrastructure, ensuring better services. Since March/April 2020, with nationwide lockdown imposed by government, ONGC projects have shifted to online mode using WhatsApp, GOTO-Meeting Apps, tele-calling etc. even though internet in Kashmir is terribly slow due to security reasons. The progress has been lauded by Army and it feels that this effort under extremely difficult times will go a long way to strengthen our efforts to bring peace in the valley. ONGC support to REACHA for the above projects have provided tremendous encouragement, support, and high impact to Army efforts to counter militancy in a peaceful manner. As per Army, Baramulla has today become much less prone to stone pelting, terror attacks and other anti-national activities since most of the youth look forward to enhancing their career prospects at ONGC supported initiatives, thereby mainstreaming themselves into the national fabric</p>

With their support, and under Army supervision, REACHA has set up a Cell for Livelihood Enhancement (CLE) at Chinar 9 Jawan Club, Baramulla, J&K. The main objective of CLE is to take up innovative market aligned activities like training of trainers, scholarships for jobs, support to set up Women’s Self Help Groups (SHGs) so that local women may be able to set up sustainable enterprises, etc. and thereby become financially independent.

CLE has had considerable success in the 18 months that it has rolled out on ground.</p>
